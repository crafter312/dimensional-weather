# fabric-dimensional-weather-1.20.4

CURRENT FEATURES
----------------

The purpose of this mod is solely to fix https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-186626. The ability to set separate weather conditions across custom dimensions is required for another mod I'm working on called [Immersive Backrooms](https://github.com/crafter312/fabric-backrooms).
